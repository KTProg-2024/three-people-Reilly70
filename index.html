            Vincent Albert "Buddy" Cianci Jr. (/siˈænsi/, see-AN-see; Italian pronunciation: [ˈtʃaŋtʃi], CHAHN-chee; April 30, 1941 – January 28, 2016) was an American politician, attorney, radio talk show host, political commentator, and convicted felon who served as the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island from 1975 to 1984 and again from 1991 to 2002. Cianci was the longest-serving mayor of Providence and one of the longest-serving mayors in United States history, having held office for over 21 years.
           <br>
            Cianci was twice elected Mayor of Providence. Earlier in his career he served as a state prosecutor in the Rhode Island Department of Attorney General. Cianci was forced to resign from office during both mayoral tenures due to felony convictions. His first administration ended in 1984 when he pleaded nolo contendere to charges brought against him involving kidnapping and torturing a man Cianci believed was romantically involved with his ex-wife. His second stint as mayor ended when he was forced to resign following his conviction for one count of racketeering conspiracy, and he served four years in federal prison.[1]
           <br>
            Cianci was first elected mayor as the candidate of the Republican Party. While in office, he declared himself an independent and, as of 2009, he said that he had no party affiliation.[1] On his radio show in June 2014, Cianci announced that he would run for mayor again. He was defeated by Democratic candidate Jorge Elorza in the 2014 election.

            Jerry Tillinghast grew up in South Providence, a rough part of town. After serving in the Vietnam War, he returned home and was arrested in connection with the murder of a local bookie. While awaiting trial in prison, he met mob boss Raymond Patriarca and joined the ranks of New England organized crime.
           <br>
           Later, Jerry gathered votes for Buddy Cianci in exchange for a city job. In 1976, he was acquitted of involvement in the Bonded Vault heist.

          Raymond L.S. Patriarca ruled Providence for decades as the boss of the New England crime family. He conducted his business from a run-down storefront called the Coin-O-Matic in Federal Hill, Providence's Italian neighborhood. If you ran a card game or any illegal business, you had to kick up a portion of your profits to Patriarca. If you didn't, you were in serious trouble.
